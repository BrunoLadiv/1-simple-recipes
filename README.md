### Simple Recipes Project

In this project, I utilized the following technologies:

- HTML: I used HTML to structure the web pages, create headings, paragraphs, lists, and include images.
- CSS: I have utilized Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to bring life and personality to the content and layout. CSS plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall user experience and ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.
